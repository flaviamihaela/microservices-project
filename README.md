# microservices-project

## Main idea overview:

Develop a series of services that enable a fellow programmer to store spontaneous coding ideas, assign them a category and then retrieve one at random from a particular category when kickstarting a new personal project


## Main Services:

Project Service= to create and view project categories (acts like a project catalogue)

Fetch service= can fetch/retrieve a project idea under a certain category

Inventory Service= can check if project from a particular category is available or not 

Notification Service= stateless service with no database that sends notifications to users
